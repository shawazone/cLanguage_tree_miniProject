# cLanguag_tree_miniProject
The objective of this project is to create a binary search tree of birds according to their weight. A
bird is characterized by his type (string) and his weight (real number).
1. Give the necessary data types allowing to define an element of the binary tree.
2. Write a function allowing to create an empty tree.
3. Write a function allowing to create a leaf of a binary tree.
4. Write a function allowing to create an internal node of the binary tree (left node and right
node as well as the weight and type of the bird are given as parameters of the function).
5. Write a function allowing to add a bird to the binary search tree.
6. Write a function allowing to display the elements of the tree (i.e. weights and types of birds)
in the corresponding order, i.e. the bird having the smallest weight to the heaviest.
7. Write a function that calculates the average weight of birds.
8. Write a function that count the number of birds having a weight greater than the average.
9. Write a function that saves in a file the elements of the binary tree in the postfixed order.
10. Write a function allowing to display the content of the file created.
11. Write the main function allowing to test all previous functions.
